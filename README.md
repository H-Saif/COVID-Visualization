# COVID-Visualization
The purpose of this project is to calculate COVID case fatality ratios (CFR) of six different states and five races. The program takes the data of states, races, cases by race, and deaths by race from a text file. After calculation, the data is sorted using insertion sort. The program creates a GUI window that displays a visual bar graph that represents the data of each state. Multiple buttons on the GUI allow to switch between states and methods of sorting (Alpha or CFR). The program utilizes several different data types and structures.
